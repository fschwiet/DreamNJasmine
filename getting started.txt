Getting started with NJasmine:

1)  Reference NJasmine.dll, PowerAssert.dll, and 
NUnit.framework.dll from your test project.

2)  Copy NJasmine.dll and PowerAssert.dll to the addins 
folder of your NUnit binaries.

Suppose you're running nunit.exe at 
"c:\Program Files (x86)\NUnit 2.5.9\bin\net-2.0".  Then 
you need to put NJasmine.dll and PowerAssert.dll at path 
"c:\Program Files (x86)\NUnit 2.5.9\bin\net-2.0\addins"

3)  Create a class in your test project and inherit from 
GivenWhenThenFixture.

4)  Override GivenWhenThenFixture.Specify() in your derived
class.

5)  Start writing tests.
